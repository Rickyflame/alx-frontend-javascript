Modify

    function taskFirst to instantiate variables using const
    function taskNext to instantiate variables using let


1:
Given what you’ve read about var and hoisting, modify the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren’t overwritten inside the conditional block.
2:
Rewrite the following standard function to use ES6’s arrow syntax of the function add (it will be an anonymous function after)

3:
Condense the internals of the following function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.

Hint: The key here to define default parameter values for the function parameters.

4:Modify the following function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax

5:
Using spread syntax, concatenate 2 arrays and each character of a string by modifying the function below. Your function body should be one line long.

6:
Rewrite the return statement to use a template literal so you can the substitute the variables you’ve defined.

7:
Notice how the keys and the variable names are the same?

Modify the following function’s budget object to simply use the keyname instead.

8:
Rewrite the getBudgetForCurrentYear function to use ES6 computed property names on the budget object

9:
Rewrite getFullBudgetObject to use ES6 method properties in the fullBudget object

10:
Rewrite the function appendToEachArrayValue to use ES6’s for...of operator. And don’t forget that var is not ES6-friendly.

11:
Write a function named createEmployeesObject that will receive two arguments:

    departmentName (String)
    employees (Array of Strings)


12:
Write a function named createReportObject whose parameter, employeesList, is the return value of the previous function createEmployeesObject.

13:
Write a function named createIteratorObject, that will take into argument a report Object created with the previous function createReportObject.

This function will return an iterator to go through every employee in every department.

14:
Finally, write a function named iterateThroughObject. The function’s parameter reportWithIterator is the return value from createIteratorObject.
